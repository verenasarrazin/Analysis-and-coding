# Regression - Predicting Wine Quality

This is a project I created as part of the CodeFirstGirls +Masters in AI and ML which I completed recently. I worked with a [publicly available dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality) which contains information on chemical properties of different types of white and red wine. The aim of my analysis was to predict the quality rating of each wine based on those chemical properties.

The full analysis including pre-processing is included in the following Jupyter notebook:
- [Predicting Wine Quality Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/verenasarrazin/Analysis-and-coding/blob/main/WineQualityDataset/Wine_project_Verena_Sarrazin.ipynb)

## Outline
**1. Preprocessing**
  - Train-test split
  - Log-transformation of variables with skewed distribution
  - Outlier removal
  - Standardisation of predictor variables
    
**2. Exploratory Data Analysis**
  - Correlation matrix
  - Relationship of predictors and the outcome variable
    
**3. Machine Learning Analysis**
  - Linear Regression
  - Elastic Net Regression
  - Support Vector Regression
  - Random Forest Regression
  - Random Forest Regression with PCA
    
**4. Model Evaluation and Interpretation**
