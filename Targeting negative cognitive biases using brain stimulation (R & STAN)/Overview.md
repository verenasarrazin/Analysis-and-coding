# Targeting Negtaive Cognitive Biases Using Brain Stimulation 

This is the main project I conducted during my DPhil. The aim of the project was to test whether transcranial direct curent stimulation (tDCS), 
a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, can normalise reward and punishment learning in depression. Depression has previously been associated with
deficits in reward and punishment learning. These deficits might to lead to an increased focus on negative information, which are thought to cause and maintain
depressive symptoms. Normalising these deficits in reward and punishemnt learning might therefore be a novel intervention approach.
