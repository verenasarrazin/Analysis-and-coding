# Cognitive Phenotyping

This project aims at exploring cognitive phenotypes of depression. Depression is associated with large variability in symptomatology as well as in treatment response. It has therefore been suggested that different phenotypes of depression might exist with different underlying psychopathology. Individuals with the same phenotype of depression might be similar in psychopathology and might therefore respond to the same treatment. 

The goal of this project is to test whether different phenotypes of depression can be identified based on the performance of cogntive tasks (for example tasks capturing negative cognitive biases). I am investigating which parameters extracted from five different cognitive tasks could capture distinct symptom dimensions of depression.
