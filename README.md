# Analysis & Coding

Below, I am sharing scripts I have created for research projects during my DPhil and post-doc, as well as scripts for data science projects I have been working on to extend my coding skills.

## Research projects

#### Targeting negative cognitive biases using brain stimulation (R & STAN)
- Fitting a reinforcement learning model using grid approximation
- Fitting a reinforcement learning model using STAN
- Removing outliers, ANOVAs, t-tests, correlations
- Creating figures in ggplot

#### Cognitive phenotyping (R & Python)
- PCA
- Extracting task measures (faces task)
- Regression analysis


## Data science projects

- Journal Ranking Database (SQL)
