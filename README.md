# Analysis & Coding

Below, I am sharing scripts I have created for research projects during my DPhil and post-doc, as well as scripts for data science projects I have been working on to extend my coding skills.

## Research projects

### <a href="https://github.com/verenasarrazin/Analysis-and-coding/tree/main/Targeting%20negative%20cognitive%20biases%20using%20brain%20stimulation%20(R%20%26%20STAN)" title="Targeting negative cognitive biases using brain stimulation (R & STAN)">Targeting negative cognitive biases using brain stimulation (R & STAN)</a>

- Fitting a reinforcement learning model using grid approximation
- Fitting a reinforcement learning model using STAN
- Removing outliers, ANOVAs, t-tests, correlations
- Creating figures in ggplot

#### Cognitive phenotyping (R & Python)
- PCA
- Extracting task measures (faces task)
- Regression analysis


## Data science projects
