# Classification - Predicting Hiring Decisions

This was a group project that I completed as part of my CodeFirstGirls +Masters in AI & ML. The aim of this project was to build a model that can predict whether someone will be hired or not based on their education, work experience etc. The dataset is freely available on kaggle.com. 

The analysis is described in detail in the following file:
- [Predicting Hiring Decisions Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/verenasarrazin/Analysis-and-coding/blob/main/HiringDecisionsDataset/HiringDataset.ipynb)

My contributions to the project were:
- developing the analysis question
- search for a relevant dataset
- data pre-processing
- setting up machine learning pipelines
- model comparison and evaluation
- interpretation of the resuls

The analysis is structured in the following way:
